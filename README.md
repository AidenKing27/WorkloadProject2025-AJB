## Aiden, Josh, Balkaran

MAKE YOUR CHANGES ON A SEPARATE BRANCH ON THE REPO I WILL MAKE WITH MY CURRENT APP, WE WILL MERGE AFTER

# Objectives:
- [ ] normalize all pages to use same UI design patterns (Aiden)

- [ ] remove hard coded data from prototype pages and replace with actual database values (Balkaran)

- [ ] determine if we need to include the current FacultyWorkloadDashboard.razor page, do we need to combine all our workload pages into one? (?)

- [ ] update faculty table to include a bool for IsFulltime and display on faculty page (Josh)
	- [ ] update the FacultyForm to include this checkbox (Josh)
	
- [ ] update workload table to directly assign term instead of assigning term to course, remove term from course table (Aiden)
	- [ ] update the WorkloadForm to include this dropdown to select Term (Aiden)
	
- [ ] display subtotals per program and grand totals for faculty member (to determine category) apply this for the Faculty Workload Page (?)

- [ ] display entire grand total of all workload hours per program on the Program Dashboard (?)

- [ ] fix functionality for CSV exporting from each respective dashboard (?)

- [ ] add a Course Dashboard page? (?)

- [ ] display all Faculty in a respective Program on the Program Dashboard (add to other dashboards?) (?)


# Back Burner:
- [ ] Understand what is required for the Semester page, how we will do this (determine if copying catalogue, or from prev workload) (?)

- [ ] UNSURE: display the primary teacher on a per course basis on the course dashboard based on hours (?)

- [ ] UNSURE: calculate primary and co-teacher based on hour splits (?)

- [ ] UNSURE: better displaying and filtering for faculty (?)

- [ ] add additional course types for release/sick leave/overload/chair release (?)

- [ ] check other factors to determine split if its 50/50 for the primary/co (?)

- [ ] historical data (?)

- [ ] permission levels (?)
