# Back Burner:
- [ ] Understand what is required for the Semester page, how we will do this (determine if copying catalogue, or from prev workload) (?)

- [ ] UNSURE: display the primary teacher on a per course basis on the course dashboard based on hours (?)

- [ ] UNSURE: calculate primary and co-teacher based on hour splits (?)

- [ ] UNSURE: better displaying and filtering for faculty (?)

- [ ] Add additional course types for release/sick leave/overload/chair release (?)

- [ ] Check other factors to determine split if its 50/50 for the primary/co (?)

- [ ] Historical data (?)

- [ ] Permission levels (?)
